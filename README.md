ABSTRACT :
 
 In our society, we have people with disabilities. The technology is 
developing day by day but no significant developments are undertaken for the 
betterment of these people. Communications between deaf-mute and a normal 
person has always been a challenging task. It is very difficult for mute people to 
convey their message to normal people. Since normal people are not trained on 
hand sign language. In emergency times conveying their message is very difficult. 
The human hand has remained a popular choice to convey information in situations 
where other forms like speech cannot be used. Voice Conversion System with 
Hand Gesture Recognition and translation will be very useful to have a proper 
conversation between a normal person and an impaired person in any language.
New system that helps convert sign language to text and speech for easier 
communication with audience.
